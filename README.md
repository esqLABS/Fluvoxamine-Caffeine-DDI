# Fluvoxamine-Caffeine-DDI
Modeling of published clinical Fluvoxamine-Caffeine-DDI studies for model evaluation

### Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim project file containing simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of our models regarding the Fluvoxamine-Caffeine-DDI, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied [caffeine model](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Example_Caffeine/blob/master/Caffeine.pksim5) is a template model provided in PK-Sim. For further details and documentation please refer to [[1](#reference)].

### License
The model is distributed under the [GPLv2 License](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Suite/blob/develop/LICENSE).
